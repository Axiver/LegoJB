# LegoJB

This is code from a discord bot that I made for the Lego's Servers Discord Server. They ran a Jailbreak server for CSGO. I'm releasing this as it is unlikely that they will open up ever again.

The code has been modified from its original form as it contained confidential information. You may modify this for your own usage.

That being said, I may come back to this project in the future to add customisability or just improve it in general.

## Getting started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development, testing or production purposes. See Installing for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You need Nodejs and npm (which comes with nodejs) to use this bot.

[Download Nodejs and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/)

### Installing
#### Node packages

After downloading Nodejs and npm, `cd` into the directory you installed the bot to and run `npm i`. It should automatically install all the needed modules for this bot to work.

#### Setup

I will update this section after I modify the original file in preparation of pushing to the repo.

#### Modification of files
